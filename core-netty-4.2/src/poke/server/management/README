The management package provides server-behavior for responding 
to requests relating to the health-and-status, and network 
management queries.

This relationship can be shown as:

1) simple client-server

Client (HeartMonitor) ----> Server (ManagementHandler)

2) server-server

Server (ManagementHandler + HeartMonitor) ----> Server (ManagementHandler)

InboundManagementQueue are for incoming messages and OutboundManagementQueue for outgoing messages:  

The way it works in netty is    incoming message(protobuff message) -> store in queue(inbound queue) -> invoke handlers (FIFO) 
-> accept/discard message
